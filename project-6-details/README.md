## Libraries used

`@openzeppelin/contracts` has been used to get more familiar with the contracts available in the library.
Specifically, I used Context to retrieve the msg.sender from.
`@truffle/hdwallet-provider` has been used to deploy to public test network
`@truffle/contract` has been used to interact with the contract from the browser
